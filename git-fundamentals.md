# Git Fundamentals

You should already understand git branching, merging, and working with remote repositories.

A great background course is: http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics 

Team Treehouse offers a free 14 day trial, sign up here: http://referrals.trhou.se/ivanstorck 

If you have not already, follow the directions in https://github.com/codefellows/sea-b24-git-workshop README
Double check that the repo name above includes the same course code as the class you are enrolled in.

This is a required pre-work step for the class. We will not be going over making branches and pull requests in the Dev Accelerator.
