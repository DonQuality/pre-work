1. Click on Settings, in the top right of Canvas. Then, click on the Edit Settings button on the right. Make sure your timezone is set to Pacific time. This is important because the default is Mountain Time. 

2. Add other contact information. A backup email (if you have one), a phone # (useful in case of emergency).

3. Add a picture of yourself. Not your cat, pet llama, or a Klingon. Add a nice head-shot so that we can learn your names faster and give you feedback on assignments better. 

4. Add a link to your Github profile. It can be hard to match up usernames and real people names. Please make this easy on your teachers, your fellow students, and your prospective employers.

5. Click on Notifications and make sure everything is set to ASAP. Because of the compressed time frame of this course we've found this is best.


There is no submission required for this assignment, but please make sure to complete the steps above.
